# Swarm Ego

## Introduction

In Swarm Ego, your goal is to find which character you control and save yourself.

### Inspiration

This game is heavily inspired from Unspottable, a couch game where every player and NPC have the same model, and the goal is to find the other players and kill them.

It is also inspired by the random minigames in Super Mario Party where you have to pick a side, and only one side is safe.

### Player Experience

The player controls a character, and there are many other NPCs that are the exact same as the player around them. By moving, the player has to find where they are, and then try to stay alive.

There is also a multiplayer mode where the opponent movements influence the other players

### Development Software

- Godot engine version >= 4.5

### Genre

Puzzle, Party game

### Targe Audience

Casual players, families



## Concept

### Gameplay Overview

There are many characters on screen. When moving, all the characters move, with a fraction of them moving in the same direction as the player.

### Primary Mechanic

At the beginning, the player doesn't know which character they control.
When moving, a fraction of the characters move in the same direction as the player. The other characters move in a random direction.
After a while, the fraction of the characters that follow the player is randomized. This allows the player to know which character they control.

### Secondary Mechanic

Hazards: After a while, hazards start to appear on the map, killing some of the characters. The goal is to survive.


## Art

To be decided


## Audio

Idea: very rythmic music, upbeat, such as the one from the Rythm Paradise tutorials. The characters move in sync with the music, and the characters moving the player get re-randomized on each 8th beat.


## Game Experience

The game will feature different maps with increasing difficulty (i.e. number of characters). Each map has different hazards to deal with.
